/**
 *
 * This is an example compoment that contains all the options.
 *
 * Either the component is pulled from a docker registry or built using source.
 *
 * If the component is built from source then the user may be able to configure
 * certain aspects of its configuration. The configuration array lists the
 * files and attributes the user may alter through the Kalabox UI. When the user
 * does alter these values, Kalabox will take their results and generate a new
 * dockerfile to use in the build. What this means is that kalabox should be
 * able to take as input, a component, whether as a plugin or generated through
 * the ui and build a container with it.
 *
 * Kalabox Dockerfile Axiom 1:
 * pirog/kalastack-docker/Dockerfile = Kalabox.buildDockerFile(component.json)
 *
 * The configuration array should contain the appropriate metadata so Kalabox
 * can grab it and create a config form for the user.
